# nb_report_icon_gen

From the project root directory run the following:

yarn dev


When a user enter a keyword it will search for an icon, download a copy of the icon, and render it on the page.

If it is a new icon, it will display the icon from the source, so rendering of the icon will not be dependent on how long it will take to download the icon.

On a page refresh, all searched icons will be rendered from the downloaded icons folder.
